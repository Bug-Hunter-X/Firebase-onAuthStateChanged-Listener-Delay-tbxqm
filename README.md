# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Listener Delay Bug

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with the Firebase `onAuthStateChanged` listener where it doesn't always trigger immediately after a successful authentication, causing a delay in updating the application's state.  The solution provided addresses this delay by incorporating a check for the user's authentication status immediately after the login/signup process.

## Bug Report

The bug occurs because the `onAuthStateChanged` listener is asynchronous, and there's a small window after successful login where the user's authentication status might not yet be reflected by the listener.  This causes application logic to execute before the user's state is updated, leading to potential errors or unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The solution utilizes the `getIdToken()` method after the successful login operation, which provides a way to synchronously confirm the authentication status and handle the update accordingly.
